                    I was born and raised here in Great Falls Montana 
                    and am currently attending Great Falls College MSU 
                    to pursue a degree in computer programming.<br />
                    My first time creating a computer program was in 
                    a JavaScrip class that I took my Softmore year 
                    as an elective. I had picked that class simply 
                    because it seemed interesting. Little did I know 
                    that it would influence the career I wanted to have 
                    later in life.<br />
                    Since then, I have continued to learn as much as I can 
                    about the different programming languages, all with 
                    the goal of starting my own freelance web design 
                    business. <br />
                    And if that doesn't work out, I guess I could always
                    try working for Google.
